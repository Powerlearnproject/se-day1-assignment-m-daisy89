Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is an engineering based approach involving the systematic process of designing,developing ,testing and maintaining
software applivations.
It plays a key role in the technology industry by enabling creation of software aplications and systems that
power various aspects of modern life including communication,commerce,entertainment and healthcare sytems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering 1998-The NATO software engineering conference marked the formal recognition of 
software egineering as a discipline by adressing the software crisis.
Intoduction of Object oriented programming-This shift allowed developers to model complex systems more effectively
using objects enhancing code reusability and maintsinablity which became essential for managing increasingly intricare software projects.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-Defines the project scope,objectives and feasability.
Requirement analysis-Analyze and document the software requirements based on a stakeholder input.
Design-Develop a blueprint of the software inckuding architecture,user interface and security measures.
Coding-Translate the design into executable code .
Testing-Conducting various texts to identify and fix bugs ensuring the software meets all requirements and function correctly.
Deployment-Releasing the siftware to users .
Maintainance-Adressing any isue arising post deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is literative and flexible promoting continous feedback and collaboration while waterfall method is linear and sequential 
requiring each phase to be completed before moving on to the next.
Agile os ideal for projects with uncertain requirements while waterfall is suitable for projects with well defined requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-Design,code ,test and maintain software applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer-Focuses on ensuring the quality of the software through systematic testing.
Project Manager-Oversees the entire software development process .

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs streamline the software development process by consolidating various tools into a single interface enhancing productivity and efficiency with benefits including code management ,standardizations and Rapid development.
VCS-They are crucial for managing changes to source code overtime and its importance include collaboration,change tracking,back up and recovery.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Unclear software requirements
Lack of communication and collaboration
Changing requirements
Time constraints
Security concerns

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-Involves testing individual components or functions of the software installations to ensure they work as intended.
It helps identify bugs early in the development process making it easier and less costly to fix them.
Itegration Testing-Focuses on the interaction between different modules or components of the applicationsto ensure they work together seamlessly.
It detects interface defects and issues that may arrise when combining units.
System Testing-Evaluates the complete and intergrated software system to verify that it meets the specific requirements.
Acceptance testing-Perfomed to determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deploymment'

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It ia a process of structuring text for generative AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:Tell me about climate change.
Improved Prompt:Provide a detailed explanation of the causes and effects of climate change including specific examples of its impact on weather 
patterns ,ecosystems,and human health over the last decade.
